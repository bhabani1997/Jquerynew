        <h1>Serialization (C#)</h1>
        <p style="color: blue">
            Serialization is the process <br>
            of converting an object into a stream <br>
            of bytes to store the object or transmit it<br>
             to <b>memory</b>, a <i>database</i>, or a file. Its main <br>
             purpose is to save the state of an object in <br>
             order to be able to recreate it when needed. <br>
             The reverse process is called deserialization.<br>
